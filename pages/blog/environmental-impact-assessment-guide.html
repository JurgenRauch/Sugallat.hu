                <p>Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a crucial process for evaluating the potential environmental effects of proposed projects. Understanding when an EIA is required and how to prepare it properly is essential for project developers and environmental consultants.</p>
                
                <h2>When is EIA Required?</h2>
                <p>EIA is mandatory for projects listed in Annexes I and II of the EIA Directive. These include major infrastructure projects, industrial installations, and developments that may significantly affect the environment. The screening process determines whether a full EIA is necessary.</p>
                
                <h2>Key Steps in the EIA Process</h2>
                <p>The EIA process typically involves several stages: screening, scoping, baseline studies, impact assessment, mitigation measures, and monitoring. Each stage requires specific documentation and stakeholder consultation.</p>
                
                <h3>1. Screening and Scoping</h3>
                <p>Determine whether an EIA is required and define the scope of the assessment. This involves identifying key environmental issues and establishing the methodology for the study.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Baseline Studies</h3>
                <p>Conduct comprehensive surveys to establish the current environmental conditions. This includes ecological surveys, air and water quality monitoring, and socio-economic assessments.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Impact Assessment</h3>
                <p>Evaluate the potential environmental effects of the proposed project, considering direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts. This requires expertise in various environmental disciplines.</p>
                
                <h3>4. Mitigation and Monitoring</h3>
                <p>Develop measures to avoid, reduce, or compensate for adverse environmental effects. Establish monitoring programs to track environmental performance during project implementation.</p>
                
                <h2>Documentation Requirements</h2>
                <p>The EIA report must include detailed information about the project, baseline conditions, impact assessment results, mitigation measures, and monitoring plans. The report should be clear, comprehensive, and accessible to non-technical audiences.</p>
