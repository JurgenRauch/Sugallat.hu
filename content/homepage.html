While it seems every motion is performed confidently, this is the result of</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>skill</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>refined through countless hours of training and repetition. But all that preparation is part of building the characteristics needed to become proficient in Valorant.</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:12pt"><span>Here are three key characteristics that elite players possess. These are not the only essential characteristics that players should have, but these three are key and likely the most essential that most</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>competitive</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>players have at a high degree of</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>control.</span></p><h3 style="margin-top:14.05pt; margin-bottom:14.05pt; page-break-inside:auto; page-break-after:auto"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#000000">Control of In-Game Mechanics</span></h3><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:12pt"><span>Having great aim is often associated with</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>top</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>players in any</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>shooter</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>games, but there’s more to it than just that. Great aim is just one part of the equation; excellent movement is equally important for securing matchups and positioning yourself in the best spots for encounters.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>This kind of</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>mastery</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>takes repetition.</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:12pt"><span>But it’s not just about moving to your spots accurately; you have to do it quickly and efficiently as well. Reaching the ideal spots sooner means you also gain the possibility of catching the opponent off guard or being able to isolate certain opponents to gain the advantage in the encounter.</span></p><h3 style="margin-top:14.05pt; margin-bottom:14.05pt; page-break-inside:auto; page-break-after:auto"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#000000">Quick-Thinking and Tactical Adaptability</span></h3><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:12pt"><span>Possessing fast trigger fingers to go with your excellent aim and movement is definitely an asset for any competitive player. Still, the ability to make quick and logical decisions is just as important. Making quick decisions while considering the current situation is crucial to keeping up with the rapidly changing battlefield. This skill is also one reason many</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>top</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>players go on to succeed in their chosen careers after leaving</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>competitive play.</span></p><h3 style="margin-top:14.05pt; margin-bottom:14.05pt; page-break-inside:auto; page-break-after:auto"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#000000">Extreme Awareness</span></h3><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:12pt"><span>In FPS games like Valorant, knowing the map well is an advantage. But when the enemy knows the map just as well as you do, it’s positional awareness that becomes key in securing the advantage for any match. Being aware of where your opponents and allies are gives you the insight needed to catch the opposing team off guard.</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:12pt"><span>By combining these three characteristics, high-level players can move in ways that regular players can only imagine. They can move from point to point in the blink of an eye, and their exceptional aim and control of movement allow them to execute kills and maneuvers consistently.</span></p><h2 style="margin-top:14.95pt; margin-bottom:14.95pt; page-break-inside:auto; page-break-after:auto"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#000000">What You’ll Get With Personalized</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#000000">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#000000">Valorant Coaching Sessions</span></h2><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:12pt"><span>The arsenal of a Valorant coach is vast, and there is so much for any player to learn.
